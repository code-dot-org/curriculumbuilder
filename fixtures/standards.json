To be well-educated citizens in a computing-intensive world and to be prepared for careers in the 21st century, our students must have a clear understanding of the principles and practices of computer science. This document delineates a core set of learning standards designed to provide the foundation for a complete computer science curriculum and its implementation at the K\u201312 level. To this end, these standards:\r\n\r\n1. Introduce the fundamental concepts of computer science to all students, beginning at the elementary school level.\r\n2. Present computer science at the secondary school level in a way that can fulfill a computer science, math, or science graduation credit.\r\n3. Encourage schools to offer additional secondary-level computer science courses that will allow interested students to study facets of computer science in more depth and prepare them for entry into the work force or college.\r\n4. Increase the availability of rigorous computer science for all students, especially those who are members of underrepresented groups. \r\n\r\nThese standards have been written to be coherent and comprehensible to teachers, administrators, and policy makers.
